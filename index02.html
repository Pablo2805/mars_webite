            <p><span>MARS</span> is a non-profile members club based in Greater Manchester. Money made
            by events held within Mars, goes back into the running costs and any improvements that come up.</p>
            <p>Mars is a venue where people can come to be welcomed into a very friendly environment where people can openly ask questions otherwise would probably be fround upon in other situations.</p>
            <h2>In the Beginning</h2>
            <p><span>Mars</span> sprung to life about 11 years ago after a special woman decided the she
            could envisage a better environment for people in the Alternative life style.</p>
            <p><span>MARS</span> is mainly made of 5 rooms</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Kitchen</b> - This is the heart of the club.</li>
                <li><b>The Lounge</b> - This is an area where you can relax, socialize and meet new people.</li>
                <li><b>The Medical Room</b> - This is a room where you can play out a medical senerio. complete with a working sink and shower to clean up after the senerio has ended.</li>
                <li><b>The Rubber Room</b> - As the name suggests... this is a rubber cladded room where people can be
                    restrained, go on a sensory journey and many other things.</li>
                <li><b>The Bunker</b> - This is the main play space which has many unique and unusal pieces of equipment that can be used during any and all events held at <span style="color: crimson">MARS</span>. All pieces of equipment can be moved around, put away or taken out depending on the members want to use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The only limitations that people have during an event at Mars is there imagination and the items they bring.</p>
